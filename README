This is a patched version of the Linux driver for the TEMPer USB thermometer
available at

http://relavak.wordpress.com/2009/10/17/temper-temperature-sensor-linux-driver/

The manufacturer of TEMPer tends to put different parts into their
thermometers depending on their revision, so it often takes a bit of
adjusting to get the driver to produce plausible results.

Please note that YMMV and that the version available here may not lead to
sufficient results for your thermometer.
